            Hi I'm <b>Vince Ladrera</b> I discovered my passion for Web Development last year during
            my time working as a Mechanical Engineer. As an individual who is very eager to develop
            new skills, I enrolled to different online courses. One of these courses is about Web
            Development, At first I was skeptical about finishing the course since it has nothing to
            do with my past work but as I try to alot time for the course, the joy I felt made me
            remember how I scrutinize with html codes when I was still a young highschool student
            using notepad which made me realize that those activities are the ones which I totally
            enjoyed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-rose-300 px-5">
            Fast forward to this day with this newly found passion, I am now pursuing my career in
            Web Development and still trying to learn new things through self study and bootcamp
            which I'm currently enrolled.
